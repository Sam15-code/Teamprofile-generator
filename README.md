# Teamprofile-generator

* [Description]()

This application will generate a team profile HTML webpage using node.js based on the user's input in the command line. User input will be captured using the inquirer module and the file will be generated using the file system (fs) module. The generated HTML webpage will display a dashboard of team profiles including a manager, engineers(s) and intern(s). Each employee will share common information such as name, id and email while other employee types will contain unique data. In addition to the HTML file, an existing CSS file will stylize all elements and provide a responsive application.
